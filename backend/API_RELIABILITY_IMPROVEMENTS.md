# API Reliability Improvements - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Issue**: Intermittent OpenAI API failures causing 10% fallback rate when running 20 test cases

---

## 🎯 PROBLEM STATEMENT

### Symptoms
- **Individual test cases**: 100% success rate when run alone
- **Batch evaluation (20 cases)**: Random failures (~10% rate)
- **Failed responses**: `"I'm sorry, I can't assist with that request"`
- **Impact**: System falls back to generic plans with BLEU-4 scores dropping to ~5-6%

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Rate Limiting**: Sending 20 API requests rapidly without delays
2. **No Retry Logic**: Single attempt per test case, no recovery from transient failures
3. **API Reliability**: OpenAI API has 0.5-2% natural error rate
4. **Content Filter False Positives**: Occasional false positives trigger refusals

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED SOLUTIONS

### 1. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

**Location**: `app/services/ai_service_for_evaluation.py:618-837`

**Implementation**:
```python
async def generate_recommendations(..., max_retries: int = 3):
    # Retry loop with exponential backoff
    for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
        try:
            # Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s
            if attempt > 0:
                wait_time = 2 ** (attempt - 1)
                await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)

            # Make API call
            response = await self.llm.ainvoke(prompt)

            # Check for refusal and retry
            if self._is_api_refusal(response.content):
                if attempt < max_retries:
                    continue  # Retry
                else:
                    return fallback  # Use fallback after all retries

            # Parse and validate
            result = json.loads(response.content)
            self._validate_response(result)
            return result  # Success!

        except (json.JSONDecodeError, Exception) as e:
            if attempt < max_retries:
                continue  # Retry
            else:
                return fallback  # Use fallback
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic recovery from transient errors
- Progressive delays prevent overwhelming API
- Maximum 3 retries (4 total attempts)
- Fallback only after exhausting all retries

---

### 2. API Refusal Detection

**Location**: `app/services/ai_service_for_evaluation.py:541-568`

**Implementation**:
```python
def _is_api_refusal(self, response_text: str) -> bool:
    """Detect OpenAI API refusals"""
    refusal_patterns = [
        "I'm sorry, I can't assist",
        "I cannot assist",
        "I'm unable to assist",
        "I can't help with that",
        # ... more patterns
    ]

    response_lower = response_text.lower().strip()
    for pattern in refusal_patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in response_lower:
            return True

    # Detect empty/invalid responses
    if len(response_text) < 100 and "{" not in response_text:
        return True

    return False
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatically detects API refusals
- Triggers retry instead of immediate fallback
- Catches empty or invalid responses

---

### 3. Rate Limiting Between Test Cases

**Location**: `scripts/run_evaluation_complete.py:355-359`

**Implementation**:
```python
for i, test_case in enumerate(test_cases, 1):
    result = await self.run_single_test_case(test_case, i)
    all_results.append(result)

    # Rate limiting: Add delay between test cases
    if i < len(test_cases):
        await asyncio.sleep(1.5)  # 1.5 second delay
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents overwhelming OpenAI API
- Reduces rate limit errors
- Minimal impact on total runtime (30 seconds for 20 cases)

---

### 4. Retry Statistics Tracking

**Location**: `app/services/ai_service_for_evaluation.py:50-58, 570-616`

**Implementation**:
```python
# Initialize tracking
self.retry_stats = {
    "total_calls": 0,
    "successful_first_try": 0,
    "retries_needed": 0,
    "total_retries": 0,
    "fallback_used": 0,
    "refusal_detected": 0
}

def print_retry_statistics(self):
    """Display retry statistics"""
    stats = self.get_retry_statistics()
    print(f"Total API Calls:           {stats['total_calls']}")
    print(f"✅ Successful (1st try):    {stats['successful_first_try']} ({stats['success_rate']:.1f}%)")
    print(f"🔄 Needed Retries:          {stats['retries_needed']} ({stats['retry_rate']:.1f}%)")
    print(f"⚠️  Fallback Used:           {stats['fallback_used']} ({stats['fallback_rate']:.1f}%)")
    print(f"🚫 API Refusals Detected:   {stats['refusal_detected']}")
```

**Display Location**: `scripts/run_evaluation_complete.py:633-636`

**Benefits**:
- Visibility into API reliability
- Track improvement over time
- Identify problematic patterns
- Measure effectiveness of retry logic

---

### 5. Comprehensive Logging

**Files Saved** (when retry/refusal occurs):
- `refusal_test_case_{id}_attempt_{attempt}.txt` - API refusal messages
- `error_test_case_{id}.txt` - Error details after all retries fail
- `raw_response_test_case_{id}.txt` - Final successful response

**Benefits**:
- Debug persistent failures
- Audit API behavior
- Track false positive patterns

---

## 📊 EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Before Implementation
- **First-try success rate**: ~90%
- **Fallback rate**: ~10%
- **Failed test cases**: 2-3 per 20 cases
- **No recovery mechanism**

### After Implementation (Expected)
- **First-try success rate**: ~90%
- **Overall success rate**: **99%+** (with retries)
- **Fallback rate**: **<1%**
- **Failed test cases**: 0-1 per 20 cases
- **Average retries when needed**: ~1.2

### Math
```
Before: 20 tests × 90% = 18 successes, 2 failures
After:  20 tests × 90% = 18 first-try successes
        2 failures × 90% retry success = 1.8 recovered
        Total: 19.8 successes, 0.2 failures (99% success rate)
```

## 🧪 TESTING & VALIDATION

### Test Command
```bash
python3 scripts/run_evaluation_complete.py --mode full --bertscore
```

### What to Check
1. **Retry Statistics Section** at end of evaluation:
   ```
   📊 API RELIABILITY STATISTICS
   ================================================================================
   Total API Calls:           20
   ✅ Successful (1st try):    18 (90.0%)
   🔄 Needed Retries:          2 (10.0%)
   📈 Total Retry Attempts:    3
   ⚠️  Fallback Used:           0 (0.0%)
   🚫 API Refusals Detected:   2
   📊 Avg Retries (when needed): 1.50
   ```

2. **Evaluation Report** (`evaluation_output/results/report_*.txt`):
   - All 20 test cases should have `Description BLEU-4: 1.0000 (100.0%)`
   - No test cases with scores like `0.0598 (6.0%)` (indicating fallback)

3. **Logs Directory** (`evaluation_logs/`):
   - Check for `refusal_*.txt` files showing retry attempts
   - Verify retries succeeded (no corresponding `error_*.txt` files)

4. **Timing**:
   - ~30 seconds added for rate limiting (20 cases × 1.5s)
   - Variable time added for retries (only when needed)
   - Total: Similar to before, but with 99% success rate

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### Why Retries Work
- **OpenAI API errors are transient**: Most failures resolve on retry
- **Content filter false positives**: Often disappear on second attempt
- **Rate limits self-correct**: Short delays allow quota to refresh

### Why Rate Limiting Helps
- **Prevents quota exhaustion**: Spreads requests over time
- **Reduces false positives**: Less aggressive = fewer content filter triggers
- **Minimal cost**: 30 seconds for 20 test cases is acceptable

### Best Practices Implemented
1. **Exponential backoff** - Standard pattern for API retries
2. **Maximum retry limit** - Prevents infinite loops
3. **Fallback after retries** - Graceful degradation
4. **Comprehensive logging** - Debug and audit trail
5. **Statistics tracking** - Measure and improve

---

## 🚀 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Adaptive rate limiting** - Slow down if errors increase
2. **Jitter in backoff** - Add randomness to prevent thundering herd
3. **Circuit breaker** - Stop trying after too many failures
4. **Alternative model fallback** - Try GPT-3.5 if GPT-4 fails
5. **Caching** - Cache successful responses for identical inputs

### Monitoring
- Track retry statistics over time
- Alert if fallback rate exceeds threshold
- Correlate failures with time of day / API load
